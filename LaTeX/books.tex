    \note{\scriptsize
    The scatter plot tracks Margit's book publications in Iceland through \emph{Prenthúsið} over a busy 8 years.

    Key insights:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Margit's output was impressive: 47 books in 8 years, which means a new book every 8-9 weeks, typically released on Tuesdays.
        \item She often stuck to a 14-chapter structure for most books.
        \item As the series progressed, the books got shorter, perhaps hinting at her comments about the narrative challenge in her epilogue,
        \emph{Is There Anybody Out There?}.
        \item Ingibjörg Jónsdóttir began translating the series in 1982, covering the first 33 books. Sadly, she passed away in 1986.
        Ingibjörg Briem then translated the remaining 14.
    \end{itemize}
