        \item As much as I wished to be there in person to share this data-driven journey with you,
        at the time of this lecture's airing, I'll be in Italy, raising a toast to our \emph{ÍSKISUR} adventure with my incredible co-hosts.

        \item I extend a massive thank you to Alvarpið and Storytel for providing the initial platform that allowed us to
        delve into the mesmerizing world of \emph{Ísfólkið}. Their unwavering support was pivotal.

        \item To our "\emph{only fan}" (all four of you) –- your enthusiasm and dedication has not gone unnoticed;
        thank you for being our steadfast cheerleader!

        \item Heartfelt gratitude to the \emph{organizers} for offering me this stage today.

        \item A tip of the hat to \emph{Reykjavík DataBeers} for inspiring the exploration of \emph{Ísfólkið} through data.

        \item A special nod to \emph{Utopia Arctic} for providing missing data and correcting some misconceptions.

        \item My deepest gratitude to \emph{Margit}. From 2016 to 2020, she was an omnipresent
        force in my life, where I was deeply engrossed in the Ice People for five years straight.

        \item To each \emph{listener}, your presence, interest, and engagement mean the world to me.
        Whether it's data, \emph{Ísfólkið}, or cats, I'm always game for a chat.
        Feel free to touch base on Twitter, email, or explore the data available on GitHub.

        \emph{Thank you!}
