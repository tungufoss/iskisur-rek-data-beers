# Legend of the Ice People Data Repository
This repository contains data associated with the *Legend of the Ice People* book series by Margit Sandemo, specifically focusing on its Icelandic book releases in written form from the 1980s and the corresponding audiobooks available on Storytel in 2017. The repository also includes code in R and Python for data analysis and manipulation.

## Contents
